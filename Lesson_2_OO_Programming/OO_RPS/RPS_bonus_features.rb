Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a two-player game where each player chooses
one of five possible moves. 
The chosen moves will then be compared to see who wins, according to the following rules:

-Scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. 
-Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. 
-Spock vaporizes rock. Rock crushes scissors.

If the players chose the same move, then it's a tie.
